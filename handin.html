                    <p class="text"> For this development site, I chose three sites that have filtering, aggregator and sorting functionality and compared factors they offer to inform my design for a similar site. I chose three sites that I use frequently, Depop, Pinterest and Google Maps. They all offer different ways to like and save liked posts, and in the process I was surprised to find that such analysis would influence my design decisions.

                    <p class="questions">Based on what worked well and didn’t, I would like to design an interface that contains a list of features that did work well:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text"> “Like” button </li>
                        <li class="text"> “Like” button reacts when hovering </li>
                        <li class="text"> List of Favourites </li>
                        <li class="text"> Edit List of Favourites </li>
                        <li class="text"> Sort List of Favourites </li>
                    </ul>


                    <p class="text">
                        The idea I came up with is inspired by my experience as a student at RISD. I constantly get asked questions such as  “do you know a voice actor for $50”, “do you know someone who can remove an arm in VFX”, “do you know a Graphic designer for a concert campaign”. The problem is that as someone with a gig, people usually turn to instagram instead of Fiver or Craiglists, because Instagram has a network effect and one is more likely to find someone with mutual connections and are local. I decided to make a site that isn’t filled with gig posts but rather works of real students. The interface is similar to Pinterest, except for most Pinterest work, it is impossible to trace back to the original artist for their work (pins are saved many many times), while for FOAM, one can save a list called “Ceramics” and be able to contact the real artist. In short, FOAM is a Pinterest-like portfolio site for art school students, a local-artist discovery site for clients to keep track of their favourite artists. In this way, clients don’t have to go through tons of applications and instead always have the ability to message artists they like, without having to go through Instagram!
